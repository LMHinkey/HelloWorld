Reminder to me: Why I'm doing this.
I'm a marine scientist who hasn't done any science in a decade. Instead, I teach biology to undergrads. (Those who can't do, teach? Those who can't teach, do?) I'm an old dog trying to learn new tricks in the world of data analysis. What the rest of world now calls "Big Data" is--in oceanography--known as data. It's all big, continuous streams of loads and loads of data in that field. But, now that everyone has access to large streams of info, there are so many more useful tools for gathering, analyzing, and sharing(!!) that data, that I want to dive back into that overflowing pool of data and swim around. But, I'd better dip my toe in to test the waters first; see if I can teach this old dog to doggy-paddle!
